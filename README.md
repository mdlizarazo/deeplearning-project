The main goal of this project was to detect speech emotion in audio files. We implemented two models: a CNN, and a LSTM.

The CNN code was developed in GoogleColab and the LSTM in Kaggle. Using as a base examples provided in Kaggle.

Each of these notebooks can be run in one on the other environment, just make sure to import the CREMA-D Dataset appropiately. The plots for the results can be found at the end and a more deep analysis is done in the report.
